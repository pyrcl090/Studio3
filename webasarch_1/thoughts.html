        <div class="thought1">Within this reading I found that the idea that “the fabrication of so-called Man” was possible as we distanced ourselves further from written text is a slightly terrifying idea. Although I think there is much truth in the idea that as we distance ourselves further from our own voice and and physical image and writing we loose parts of ourselves, I think it is unsettling to acknowledge the fact that we manipulate and change ourselves the moment we enter a mechanical, or digital realm. </div>
