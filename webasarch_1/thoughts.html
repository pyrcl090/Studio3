    <div class="thoughts">
        <div class="thought1">Within this reading I found that the idea that “the fabrication of so-called Man” was possible as we distanced ourselves further from written text is a slightly terrifying idea. Although I think there is much truth in the idea that as we distance ourselves further from our own voice and and physical image and writing we loose parts of ourselves, I think it is unsettling to acknowledge the fact that we manipulate and change ourselves the moment we enter a mechanical, or digital realm. </div>
        <div class="thought2">The idea of a website as another way to create in space is very freeing. I think many designers use the web to explore these ideas, ultimately creating something that might resemble structures that we can recognize outside of the web. Other times those visuals might exist soley on the web which is another way to see a different type of architecture taking place. However, there are still constraints to working on the web, one of which is the accessibility of access to web, so I think it’s unfair to say this is the only route. Additionally, the information on creative web projects is not super evident unless you are in a setting in which it is talked about much. </div>
        <div class="thought3">Reading Zittrain, “Battle of the Boxes" and “Battle of the Networks" (p. 11-35) The Future of the Internet—And How to Stop it. and Barlow, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace both readings addressed the general lack of control over our actions within cyberspace and the physical, monetary, and political constraints imposed on citizens globally by a few large tech giants and government officials of certain countries. While I agree there should be protections in place to secure data and to monitor misuse in cyberspace, this is not a role that the government (which at least in the U.S. has been proven to be controlled by capital and the interests of big tech and fossil fuel industries) should be involved in, in the slightest. The interests of the few are clearly represented in a greater manner that that of the many. IBM is one of these, Apple, and Microsoft, and Google, and Facebook; these companies are run in a way which nothing is asked to the masses before being imposed upon them, in ways which they are out of control. </div>
